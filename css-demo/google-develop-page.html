      DevTools lets you pause a script in the middle of its execution. While you're paused, you can use the Console to view and change the page's window or DOM at that moment in time. This makes for a powerful debugging workflow. See Get Started With Debugging JavaScript for an interactive tutorial.

The Console also has a set of convenience functions that make it easier to interact with a page. For example:

Rather than typing document.querySelector() to select an element, you can type $(). This syntax is inspired by jQuery, but it's not actually jQuery. It's just an alias for document.querySelector().
debug(function) effectively sets a breakpoint on the first line of that function.
keys(object) returns an array containing the keys of the specified object.
